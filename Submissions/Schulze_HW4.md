- Summary first, then homework questions.

**Summary of this week's forecast**

This week I was able to make histograms and some base-line statistical analyses. These proved to be useful considering the slight uptick in the flow recently.

Because no precipitation was expected, my forecast was just below the previous two week's average, the second week of the forecast was set to slightly below the first week, to allow for further recession.



**Homework questions**
# It should be noted that question 1 is actually 2 from the assignment, just that question 1 is mostly dealing with the coding.
 1. Flow data is an array and is composed of 4 columns, comprising year, month, day, and flow. Then 11585 rows, one for each day since January 1, 1989. The types of values are 64 bit floats. This totals 46,340 pieces of data.

 2. The number of times that the flow is greater than my prediction in September is 942, or 99.3% of the time.

 3. Considering only in or before 2000, every day in September from 1989 through 2000 had flow greater than my guess and that means 360 instances. Changing to in or after 2010, the number is 312 of 319 possible dates, 97.8% of the set. *This strikes me as historic.*

 4. The flow difference from the first half to the second half is reduced by about a third in a typical year. This year the flow is not decreasing as much because we are already at essentially a low flow condition.
