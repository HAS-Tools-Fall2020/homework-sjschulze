## Scott Schulze, 10/9/2020, Homework #7 aka code review #1 readme

Welcome Shweta,
I think that if you make the amendments necessary in the comments of the code, it should run smoothly. I have tried to streamline the code as much as possible for this exercise. I have attached the rubric below to help with the review section of the code.



## Week 1 and 2 forecast submission values:
week 1:

week2:


## Regression based forecasts:
week 1:

week2:



## Code review:
1. Is the script easy to read and understand?
 - Are variables and functions named descriptively when useful?

 - Are the comments helpful?

 - Can you run the script on your own easily?

 - Are the doc-strings useful?


2. Does the code follow PEP8 style consistently?
 - If not are there specific instances where the script diverges from this style?

3. Is the code written succinctly and efficiently?
 - Are there superfluous code sections?

 - Is the use of functions appropriate?

 - Is the code written elegantly without decreasing readability?
