1)

flow is a list type.

year is a list type.

month is a list type.

day is a list type.

They are composed of integers as defined in the pandas dataframe section.
Each of these has a length equal to that of the dataset, 11578.

2) The number of times that the flow is greater than my week 1 forecast in September is 938, which is 97.2 % of the September values.

3) The number of times that the flow is greater than my week 1 forecast in September is 360.The forecast value was exceeded  56.4 % of the time for the period from 1989 to 2000.

The number of times that the flow is greater than my week 1 forecast in September is 300. The forecast value was exceeded  51.9 % of the time for the period from 2010 to 2020.

4) The average flow for the first half of September is 222.7cfs and for the second half it is 205.9cfs with a decrease of 16.8cfs from the first half to the second half.

I think that until we find something much more sophisticated, I am going to stay with persistence forecasting because just following the mean and standard deviation will get you off in the woods with no hope of rescue. Experience in forecasting contests has taught me the well known phrase "The normal is never the normal".
