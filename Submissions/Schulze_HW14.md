1. What is the paper or project you picked? Include a title, a link the the paper and a 1-2 sentence summary of what its about.

The paper I found was: "Predicting cell-to-cell communication networks using NATMI" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18873-z#code-availability
It is a paper discussing the construction and testing of a virtual network of multiple cell types that communicate between one another and what communication paths are most commonly used. The construction of this model is also a primary focus of the paper.

2. What codes and/or data are associated with this paper? Provide any link to the codes and datasets and a 1-2 sentence summary of what was included with the paper (i.e. was it a github repo? A python package?A database? Where was it stored and how?)

https://github.com/forrest-lab/NATMI
The data provided was a github repo that had several .py files and several other files and folders. This included a very lengthy README.MD

3. Summarize your experience trying to understand the repo: Was their readme helpful? How was their organization? What about documentation within the code itself?

The README.md was well laid out including an outline but expansive. I likely could have spent 8 hours just reading the readme.
The code had no comments or documentation.

4. Summarize your experience trying to work with their repo: What happened? Where  you successful? Why or why not?

I was not able to run the code in the hour time limit, because I did not have the necessary libraries to get the code to function. I attempted to download the libraries but was also unsuccessful. 

5. Summarize your experience working with the data associated with this research. Could you access the data? Where was it? Did it have a DOI? What format was it in?

The data did not have a DOI, but was available in two separate "figshare" links and one "FANTOM5" link. Two of the files were .csv and one was a .zip

5. Did this experience teach you anything about your own repo or projects? Things you might start or stop doing?

I understand the need to be explicit, but having everything neatly laid out and orderly, and succinctly written would help. I have to be more gentle with my criticism as this is quite a sizeable piece of work. I also see the need to continue to update the files as new software becomes available as the setup used in the paper was on python 2.7
