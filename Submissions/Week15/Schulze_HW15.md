### Grade
3/3 - Great work! I'm so happy to hear that you had a good experience and that you got something out of it!  I wish we had more time to talk about parallel computing but there is definitely a lot more we could do there. 

# The end of the line
Good (insert proper greeting for time of grading here) Laura,
Thank you for the great semester. It was a fantastic experience despite all of
my anxieties at the start of the semester. I definitely did grow in my understanding of the tools and processes used in our field.

# Reflection
1. From Ocelote, I requested a core and one processor of that core, and 6gb of RAM. My wait in the queue was non-existent from my perspective. According to the output file, my run took 18 seconds to accomplish

2. The most confusing part about setting up and running my job on Ocelote was properly scheduling the job using the pbs software script, specifically what and where the account name was. When I originally attempted to run the scripts I received an error that my account did not have any time remaining.

3. I also ran my job on the Stratus system in the HAS department. I am a member of Dr. Castro's research group and that is part of his resources that I have access to. Setting up the python environment was similar, and uploading the script was done via SFTP program, filezilla in my case. The actual run was more easily accomplished due to not needing to write a separate script for the queueing program.

4. I would be curious how difficult it would be to get our scripts into a format where the true power of the supercomputer could be brought to bear (i.e., more than one processor of a core running on our scripts).

### So long, and thanks for all the fish.
