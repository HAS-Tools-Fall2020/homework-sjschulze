For this forecast I used a persistence style in forecasting. For week 2, I increased the expected flow to 62 because of the potential for rain from a tropical system coming in. The rest of the forecast weeks I returned to 59 as it seems to be the approximate baseflow of that gauging system and with no further capabilities allowed, the best that I could do.
