    "This is easily THE MOST stressful assignment of the semester so far, only because now do I have to do everything we have done, but do it all neatly, and in one place! AHHH! I understand that this assignment should be comforting in that we can all demonstrate all we have learned throughout the semester, but, if you'll pardon the desert pun, in my case it is tapping a dry well. One required item I am fairly certain that you will not see is a map, I never got my head around that after all the issues.\n",
    "The purpose is to demonstrate many of the topics we've covered in a uniform, easy to ready story-board like presentation. Hopefully by the end, there will have been a function used(we're still not friends, functions and I), two different kinds of plots (they may well be the same data, just viewed two different ways), my forecasts for weeeks 1, 2 and the 16 week. This all will be headed by the discussion immediately following this of where I stand currently and how the forecasting has been going to date."

    "## How it is made: Forecasting episode\n",
    "When the semester started out, week 1 especially I made my forecasts just from my own guessing. I am good at recognizing patterns and adjusting. Through the middle part of the course, I used my model for generating the forecasts this was very effective when flows were so low. Now that they have returned to near normal levels, I am back to forecasting from my knowledge as I don't have the wherewithall to change my code to better suit the current conditions."
