#1)
This week I forecasted by my own intuition because I lagged in getting the data used in the assignment for so long.

#2)
The dataset added was a historical dataset containing the daily average temperature from 1-1-2010 to 11-9-2020. I did not choose this dataset so much as it chose me.
I have already stated the temporal resolution and extent, but the spatial extent was from 34 to 36°N and from 247 to 249°E and has a resolution of 2.5 degrees. The data was retrieved from the Physical Science Laboratory, operated by NOAA. My goal was to get an average temperature for the most recent weeks in the dataset, then modify the flow forecast appropriately given lower than the average temperatures, adding flow by a selected value for the condition being met.

#1)
I chose to guess my own flow forecasts for this week, due to a shortage of time and not having confidence in my code for this week.
